I'm currently working as an ML engineer at [CoreWeave](https://coreweave.com), and am also affiliated with [eleuther.ai](https://www.eleuther.ai/). Previously, I helped launch Stability AI in the role of Distinguished Engineer, and worked in more conventional Data Scientist roles at Microsoft, Amazon, Fannie Mae, USDOL-OIG, Elder Research, and SoundExchange. Common themes in my work include fighting crime with math, increasing accessibility of bleeding edge research, building tools to facilitate creative expression, pushing the boundaries of GPU training and inference performance, and applying an ecological perspective to FOSS community development.
