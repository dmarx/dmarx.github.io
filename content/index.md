## Quicklinks

* [What Am I Reading](https://dmarx.github.io/papers-feed/) - Live tracker of my (mostly academic) reading habits. How this works: I made a browser extension that logs interactions with content to github, which publishes a frontend over the data as a webapp.
* [dmarx Github Stars](https://dmarx.github.io/stars/) - I'm one of those weirdos who actually uses (and gets a lot out of) the social features on github. One consequence of this is that I have starred so many repos, it broke the github UI. So I made this webapp to help me navigate my stars.
* https://github.com/dmarx/bench-warmers - My public brainstorming space. Will almost certainly migrate that here in near future
* https://github.com/dmarx/anthology-of-modern-ml - Collection of important papers. Due for an update, but still a great collection.
