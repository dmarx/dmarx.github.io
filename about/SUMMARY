My name is David Marx, and I’m addicted to data science. This is my blog.  

I’m a Data Scientist at [Elder Research](http://elderresearch.com/), a small statistical consulting firm in the DC area. I started this blog when I was a Data Analyst at a music royalty company called [SoundExchange](http://www.soundexchange.com/) and was just getting my feet wet with data science in my spare time. I found myself spending more and more of my free time and energy teaching myself data science/machine learning/statistics/programming topics, attending lectures in the local meetup community, and engaging in hobby projects. Eventually, I gave in and got a [MS in Math/Stats from Georgetown](https://mathstat.georgetown.edu/graduate) (resulting in a significant reduction in my activity on this blog).  

The name “Unsupervised Learning” is a nod to my early efforts to teach myself analytics prior to attaining my masters degree. This blog is not specifically focused on unsupervised algorithms.
